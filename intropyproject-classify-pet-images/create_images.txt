Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three models (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) classified Dog_01.jpg as a "german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian".


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
AlexNet: Classified Dog_01.jpg as german shepherd, but Dog_02.jpg as brabancon griffon
ResNet: Classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as german shepherd
VGG: Classified Dog_01.jpg as german shepherd, but Dog_02.jpg as brabancon griffon


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: The images are actually named RedPanda_01.jpg and Car_01.jpg in the results. All three models correctly classified these as not being dogs:
RedPanda_01.jpg:

All models: classified as "lesser panda, red panda, panda, bear cat, cat bear, ailurus fulgens"

Car_01.jpg:

AlexNet and VGG: classified as "sports car, sport car"
ResNet: classified as "cab, hack, taxi, taxicab"

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: ResNet appears to have performed the best for the following reasons:

1. It correctly identified both dog images (Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg) as the same breed (german shepherd), while AlexNet and VGG misclassified Dog_02.jpg.
2. It correctly classified the non-dog images (RedPanda_01.jpg and Car_01.jpg) as not being dogs.
3. It achieved 100% accuracy in breed classification, compared to 50% for AlexNet and VGG.
4. It maintained 100% accuracy in distinguishing dogs from non-dogs, like the other models.

While ResNet misclassified the specific type of car (taxi instead of sports car), it still correctly identified it as a vehicle and not a dog. Overall, ResNet showed the most consistent and accurate performance across all four images, especially in dog breed identification, which is a key aspect of this classification task.
